# Choose Your Own Adventure Game

This project is a C++ implementation of a "choose your own adventure" gameâ€”a dynamic story engine where your choices dictate the outcome. Originally developed as part of an evaluative assignment, the project guides you through an interactive narrative with multiple paths and endings.

## Features

- **Interactive Storytelling:** Navigate through story pages by making choices that influence the outcome.
- **Multiple Endings:** Reach winning or losing conclusions based on your decisions.
- **Cycle-Free Winning Paths:** An advanced mode computes all cycle-free winning paths through the narrative.
- **Conditional Choices & Variables:** In later stages, the game supports variable assignments and conditional choices, allowing the story to remember events and adjust available options.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Comprehensive validation of story file formatting and page references ensures a smooth gameplay experience.

## Project Structure

- **cyoa-step1:** Reads and sequentially displays all story pages.
- **cyoa-step2:** Offers interactive gameplay, letting users traverse the story via their choices.
- **cyoa-step3:** Analyzes the story graph to print all cycle-free paths leading to a win.
- **cyoa-step4:** Enhances the gameplay with variable tracking and conditional logic.
- **Source Files:** Organized C++ source (`.cpp`) and header (`.h`) files implementing classes for pages, choices, and story management.
- **Makefile:** Easily compile the project using GNU Make.
